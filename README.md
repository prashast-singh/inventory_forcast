# Sales Forecasting Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive sales forecasting analysis using multiple forecasting models, ensemble methods, and ABC segmentation. The analysis includes advanced data preprocessing, model selection, forecast generation, and validation for inventory management purposes.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze historical sales data to understand patterns and trends
- Implement ABC segmentation for product prioritization
- Compare multiple forecasting models (ETS, Prophet, Croston, Seasonal Naive)
- Apply ensemble methods for improved accuracy
- Select optimal forecasting model for each product
- Generate 6-month forecasts for all products
- Validate forecasts using holdout testing
- Create interactive dashboard for visualization

## üîß Methodology

### 1. Data Analysis & Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: Historical sales data with Date, Product, and Revenue columns
- **Time Series Creation**: Monthly aggregation of revenue by product
- **Advanced Preprocessing**:
  - Outlier detection and treatment
  - Missing value imputation
  - Data smoothing techniques
  - Feature engineering for seasonality

### 2. ABC Segmentation

- **Revenue-based Classification**:
  - Segment A: Top 80% of revenue (high-value products)
  - Segment B: 80-95% of revenue (medium-value products)
  - Segment C: Bottom 5% of revenue (low-value products)

### 3. Forecasting Models

- **ETS (Exponential Smoothing)**: For trend and seasonal patterns
- **Prophet**: For complex seasonality and holiday effects
- **Croston**: For intermittent demand patterns
- **Seasonal Naive**: For stable, seasonal patterns
- **Ensemble Methods**: Weighted combinations of multiple models

### 4. Model Selection & Optimization

- **Cross-validation**: Rolling window validation with optimized parameters
- **Performance Metrics**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), MAE, RMSE
- **Automated Selection**: Best model per product based on lowest MAPE
- **Ensemble Weighting**: Dynamic weighting based on recent performance

### 5. Forecast Generation

- **6-Month Forecasts**: Predictions for all products
- **Holdout Validation**: Testing on last 6 months of historical data
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive accuracy metrics
- **Confidence Intervals**: Uncertainty quantification
